				<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" rel="nofollow">Linux is an operating system</a></span>, just like Microsoft&#8217;s Windows or Apple&#8217;s MacOS. An operating system is what makes it possible to use computer hardware. Technically, this serves as an interface between the hardware (processor, memory, sound card) and application software (Internet browser, office suite, games). Without an operating system, a computer is unusable. To be very precise, Linux is the name of the kernel of the operating system, it is the heart of it, which contains the most important programs. It is the central and almost invisible part of the system.</p>
<p class="p1">GNU/Linux is the name of the entire operating system, although it is often referred simply as Linux for abuse. GNU/Linux makes it possible to insist on the fact that many GNU tools are necessary for <a href="https://www.pornpolis.blog/"><strong>Porno HD </strong></a>the functioning of Linux, but especially to underline its freedom: the difference between GNU/Linux and other systems such as Windows or macOS is that this system d exploitation is free. For the curious, the Linux and the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.en.html" rel="nofollow"><span class="s1">GNU Project page</span></a> will explain in more detail what free means and what GNU is.</p>
<p class="p2"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft" src="https://img2.freepng.es/20180528/uqc/kisspng-gnu-linux-naming-controversy-linux-distribution-li-5b0c0ccc5bba51.6581240515275163643757.jpg" width="444" height="217" /></p>
<h2 class="p1"><b>A world-wide, easy-to-use, open-source option among the best operating systems</b></h2>
<p class="p1">Without necessarily claiming to be the best operating system, Linux <a href="https://www.pornpolis.blog/milf/"><strong><span class="___SText_cbi2o-red-team" data-ui-name="Link.Text">milf xxx</span></strong></a> is a system renowned for its stability &#8211; it is not uncommon to meet people who have not restarted their computer running Linux for many months &#8211; its security and its multitasking side &#8211; you can format a disc, listen to music, burn a backup DVD, download files from the internet, update its distribution and type the text of your monograph on flies in the same time, really, at the same time, and without crashing.</p>
<p class="p1">In addition, Linux has a very diversified software library. A Linux distribution usually comes with hundreds, if not thousands, of software. Linux is highly customizable and there are several alternatives to do almost anything. At first, it is advisable to choose the most popular software and tools. If afterwards we want to change, there are many possibilities.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="10 ways Linux is just better!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mAFMJ1LnQu8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p class="p2"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cc/10/d0/cc10d091f6187b0d27c7e7362bab026a.jpg" width="299" height="187" /></p>
<p class="p1">Linux works on an impressive number of architectures (hardware if you prefer): <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86" rel="nofollow"><span class="s1">x86 processors</span></a> (Intel Pentium, AMD Athlon and company), Alpha, ARM, Power PC (old Macintosh, G5, etc.). It is therefore found on big IBM servers (mainframes), some personal assistants (PDAs), mobile phones and tablets (Android, Firefox OS) and even parking meters. Did you know that <a href="https://opensource.com/article/19/8/everyday-tech-runs-linux" rel="nofollow"><span class="s1">Google and Facebook run entirely on Linux</span></a>? NASA uses Linux on its computers and robots in space.</p>
<p class="p1">All in all, you will quickly see that Linux, although it is less prevalent on personal computers than other operating systems, is just as pleasant an environment to use as the others and not much more difficult.</p>
<h2 class="p1"><b>Why should you start coding in Linux?</b></h2>
<p class="p1">The choice to develop software in <span class="s1">C or C ++ language</span> on Linux actually covers two decisions. First, you choose an operating system. Using Linux as a development environment is a new option in industry. The second decision concerns the language and the libraries used. Other languages ​​are indeed available, and you must be in line with the end goal of the application as well as the intended audience. The next paragraphs will examine the possibilities offered by the tools available under Linux for a good software realization in C or C ++ language.</p>
<p class="p1">Well, choosing the Linux platform to perform software development is already an important decision. Several motivations can be at the origin of this choice. First of all, Linux is probably the best operating system for distributing <span class="s1">free software, websites like <a href="https://geile.blog/joyclub/">joyclub</a> can be made thanks to free software like this</span>. The spirit of the Linux community is such that a new project is generally well received, and the enthusiasm of the participants allows the rapid progression of software, provided the team is sufficiently motivated.</p>
<p class="p2"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bL11VcacNzQ/XMaWOjnR3BI/AAAAAAAAAJw/enVNcqjvhz0XDQ2WLS8BkjzVLP9TNk51gCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_20190428_132446_641.jpg" width="279" height="338" /></p>
<p class="p1">This type of choice is no longer only made by amateurs or students, but some companies have already understood the immediate interest for them in adhering to the logic of free software. This is the case, for example, with some manufacturers of computer peripherals: they distribute the technical specifications of their hardware in the development of free drivers for operation under Linux. The choice of the Linux system as a development environment can also be motivated by the quality of the tools available &#8220;freely&#8221; and the documentation available on the Internet. Upon installation, any Gnu/Linux distribution includes all the software tools needed by the programmer &#8211; editors, compilers, debuggers &#8211; for all commonly used computer languages.</p>
<p class="p1">In addition, porting applications to other <span class="s1">Unix environments</span> is often very fast, since it only requires a simple recompilation of the source files. It is then possible to have PC type development stations, which are powerful and economical. Note also that Linux, far from being limited to PCs, is available on a wide variety of machines. Applications running under this system automatically have &#8220;internal&#8221; portability across a full range of different architectures and processors.</p>
<p class="p1">However, the most common motivation for Linux development is simply the choice of this system as the final application platform. This solution has been used for several years in many laboratories, study centers, etc. The use of Linux as the primary environment for industrial applications is more recent, but once initial reservations have been overcome, there is usually a slow but steady increase in the number of machines running Linux within an organization.</p>
<p class="p1">To ensure the success of an application development under Linux, it is important to clearly target in which category the product fits: free software distributed on the Internet or reserved for internal use; application intended to be widely ported to other operating systems or conversely limited to use only under Linux. This influence both the programming tools and languages ​​to use, and the priority goals that the team of developers should set for themselves.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="TOP 6 BEST WONDERFUL Linux Distros [ 2020 Edition ]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CbnuKnYKaL0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2 class="p1"><b>How to choose the better language for my Linux development?</b></h2>
<p class="p1">In the industrial world, one of the most popular strengths of the Linux system is its remarkable stability. Correctly configured stations can have very long uninterrupted uptime. The only shutdowns of the system are then due to the hardware components, and not to the software. This results in particularly high system availability rates, which is very valuable in certain types of applications.</p>
<p class="p1">The most frequently cited example is that of the web server. <a href="https://www.openoffice.org/download/" rel="nofollow"><span class="s1">Apache free software</span></a> is widely used to build efficient and inexpensive servers under Linux. To configure and customize a network server, we often use the <a href="https://www.perl.org/" rel="nofollow"><span class="s1">Perl language</span></a>, which allows you to quickly write small powerful scripts, to boost the content of web pages, to program software robots managing mailing lists or to sort and distribute mail or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet" rel="nofollow"><span class="s1">Usenet articles</span></a>.</p>
<p class="p2"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright" src="https://img.devrant.com/devrant/rant/r_2279210_2oE39.jpg" width="368" height="327" /></p>
<p class="p1">For applications requiring greater technical involvement, the most used languages ​​are C and C ++. Portability is a bit more restricted, mainly regarding the user interface. In fact, the Linux kernel, as well as all the system utilities, are written in C. The use of this language therefore allows easy access to the low-level resources essential in certain applications (interfacing, writing a device driver, etc.). The C language offers technical advantages in terms of power and speed, particularly suitable for scientific and industrial applications. In addition, as a compiled language, it provides a stand-alone executable file, which ensures the confidentiality of the algorithms used in the sources. This aspect constitutes, in certain circumstances, a real advantage over other languages.</p>
<p class="p1">The graphical environment used in Linux is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System" rel="nofollow"><span class="s1">XWindow system</span></a>. This very powerful system is particularly interesting on networked machines, because it allows displays to be deported to remote stations. X-Window imposes very few obligations in terms of the appearance of applications. Therefore, many different graphics libraries coexist, sometimes making porting applications somewhat difficult.</p>
<p class="p1">Two main graphical environments currently exist: the <a href="https://www.gnome.org/"><span class="s1">Gnome system</span></a>, from the GNU project, and the <a href="https://kde.org/" rel="nofollow"><span class="s1">KDE system</span></a>. Both are installed automatically with most current distributions, and the user chooses their preferred environment upon login. These environments affect the appearance and behavior of windows (system menu, borders, mouse reaction, etc.), but also have an important role in communication between applications.</p>
<p class="p1">Choosing to use the Gnome or KDE environment for an application&#8217;s user interface is therefore not an innocent action. Another possibility is to use a portable library on all Unix systems. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_(software)%23:~:text=Motif%2520is%2520the%2520basic%2520building,standard%2520desktop%2520for%2520commercial%2520Unix.&amp;text=As%2520of%2520version%25202.1%252C%2520Motif,used%2520in%2520several%2520multilingual%2520environments." rel="nofollow"><span class="s1">Motif environment</span></a> has established itself as a de facto standard in industrial computer systems. There are several commercial implementations of this in Linux, as well as a free implementation called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LessTif"><span class="s1">Lesstif</span></a>. The use of these libraries helps to ensure portability of graphics applications, while maintaining the efficiency and performance of a compiled language close to the machine.</p>
<h2 class="p1"><b>Development tools that will make your life easier in Linux</b></h2>
<p class="p1">The development tools freely available in Linux are surprisingly powerful. At the heart of programming in C or C ++ language is naturally the compiler. The one used in Linux is called <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/" rel="nofollow"><span class="s1">GCC</span></a>. This is a compiler produced by the GNU Project, the purpose of which is to freely provide replacement software for all system utilities and development tools under Unix. The GCC compiler is nothing specific to Linux. It represents an interesting alternative to very expensive compilers, since it allows to equip easily and inexpensively all the stations of the developers of a team. GCC is available in several versions installed jointly, depending on whether you prefer to use the C language, C ++, or even the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C" rel="nofollow"><span class="s1">Objective C dialect</span></a>. The many options available to adjust the configuration of the compiler allow you to adapt its behavior to the wishes of the programmer, particularly with regard to compliance with the most common standards (Posix, Iso C99, etc.).</p>

<p class="p1">The GCC compiler is a command line tool, which can therefore be started directly &#8220;by hand&#8221; by indicating the desired options and the source files to be compiled. This utility performs only one task, but it performs it best, without user interface considerations distracting it from its role, distractions like <a href="https://geile.blog/">free porn</a> and many others. To improve the ergonomics of the programmer, there are however a certain number of integrated development environments, which include a text editor for entering source files, and graphic components (buttons, menus, etc.) to directly invoke the compiler in background, making sure you are using the correct options. These environments also allow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Debugger%23:~:text=The%2520GNU%2520Debugger%2520(GDB)%2520is,%252C%2520Go%252C%2520and%2520partially%2520others." rel="nofollow"><span class="s1">GNU debugger, named GDB</span></a>. Like the compiler, this tool works by invocation from a command line, and then offers a minimal user interface. Integrated development environments frame it and present a more attractive graphical interface, allowing the execution of a program instruction by instruction, inspection of variables, and more.</p>

<p class="p1">The GNU project brings together a complete set of tools to support the developer&#8217;s work. These include, for example, archiving utilities for creating custom function libraries, source code covers to standardize the appearance of files created by different team members, RCS or CVS tools that provide version control and thus, allow simultaneous work by several developers on the same project while minimizing the risk of competitive modifications.</p>
<h2 class="p1"><b>The Linux community is the biggest success of this operating system</b></h2>
<p class="p1">The immense documentation available on the Linux environment is one of the features of this system that is most appealing to programmers. One can <a href="https://www.whizlabs.com/blog/best-linux-blogs/" rel="nofollow"><span class="s1">find on Internet sites</span></a> gathering high quality information in all the fields interesting the developer.</p>
<p class="p1">With regard to the Linux environment in general, the installation and configuration of applications or the administration of the system, consult the HOW-TO documents, translated into many languages, and which gather information on most of the important subjects for the users.</p>

<p class="p1">The programmer can always consult the sources of the kernel or those of the C library at will, which represents not only a source of exact information regarding a precise functionality, but also powerful and often elegant examples of implementation.</p>
<p class="p1">The functionality offered by the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/" rel="nofollow"><span class="s1">Linux kernel</span></a> and the higher-level routines offered by the standard C library are seldom sufficient to build a complete application. It is often necessary to use other libraries that do various tasks. Let us quote for example the existence of libraries integrating algorithms of compression, encryption, reading of graphic files in most of the usual formats. It is also possible to mention the option of accessing objects available on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Object_Request_Broker_Architecture" rel="nofollow"><span class="s1">Corba bus</span></a> or even using gateways to other development languages ​​such as Python, Perl or Tcl/Tk. All these libraries are available in the form of freely searchable source code and adaptable to specific needs.</p>

<p>In Scaling Up Excellence, bestselling author, Robert Sutton and Stanford colleague, Huggy Rao Sutton offer a comprehensive guide to management in a package of enticing stories, subtly supported by references to high-end research. Their personal history in the <a href="https://www.pornochacha.com/porno-casero/">porno casero</a> Silicon Valley and their global access to interesting organizations provides a relevant backdrop. </p>



<p>The main theme is that, while many good practices exist in organizations, they either get lost or there are difficulties when attempts are made to spread them (scale them) across the organization. </p>



<p>This theme means that this book will provide value to anyone who would like to see organizations improve. The benefits are not limited by industry, functional area or organizational size.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1457369804613-52c61a468e7d?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80" alt="open book lot"/></figure></div>



<h3><strong>What books do alumni from the Stanford Graduate School of Business recommend? </strong></h3>



<p>Here’s one: Orbiting the Giant Hairball: A Corporate Fool’s Guide to Surviving with Grace by Gordon MacKenzie </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“It was written by a guy who made Hallmark cards. It’s about maintaining creativity in a corporate structure.”</p><cite>–– Tristan Walker, founder of Walker &amp; Company </cite></blockquote>



<p>Any business can morph into a giant hairball, a tangled, impenetrable mass of rules, traditions, and systems based on what worked in the past that can plunge it into mediocrity. Gordon MacKenzie worked at Hallmark Cards for thirty years. Much at that time he worked hard to get his colleagues to go into “orbit”, to a mode of dreaming, daring and doing above and beyond the rubber-stamp confines of the administrative mind-set. </p>



<p>In his deeply funny book, exuberantly illustrated in full color, he shares the story of his own professional evolution, together with lessons on awakening and fostering creative genius.</p>



<p>Originally self-published and already a business &#8220;cult classic&#8221;, this personally empowering and entertaining book explores the intersection between human creativity and the bottom line. A must-read for any manager looking for new ways to invigorate employees, and any professional who wants to achieve his or her best, most self-expressive, most creative and fulfilling work. </p>



<h2>Inspiration Awaits</h2>



<p>5 Influential Business Books You Need to Read Dartmouth The syllabus for Managerial Decision Making at the Tuck School for Business at Dartmouth includes this unexpected yet captivating read: Moneyball: </p>

<p> The story of The Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management is a compelling one not only for people interested in finance, but for anyone fascinated by the spectacle of very smart people losing enormous sums of money. </p>



<p>Lowenstein&#8217;s book makes this story accessible by glossing over some of the technical details, a tradeoff of readability for depth, but still provides insight into the causes of LTCM&#8217;s collapse. In this business classic, now with a new afterword in which the author draws parallels to the recent financial crisis, Lowenstein captures the gripping roller-coaster ride of Long-Term Capital Management. </p>

<h2>Influences that can help</h2>



<p>Drawing on confidential internal memos and interviews with dozens of key players, Lowenstein explains not just how the fund made and lost its money but also how the personalities of Long-Term’s partners, the arrogance of their mathematical certainties, and the culture of Wall Street itself contributed to both their rise and their fall.</p>



<p>Influence has established itself as the most important book on persuasion ever published. This book explains the psychology of why people say, yes and how to apply these findings to others and your own life. Distinguished psychologist, Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D., explains why some people are remarkably persuasive and how you can beat them at their own game. </p>



<p>This indispensable book guarantees you’ll never again say, yes when you really mean, no, and how to make yourself into your most influential self. </p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Oh Linux, not everyone knows how to understand your awesomeness. Not everyone gets your amazing characteristics and features. The half of the world misleads your excellence.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Are you already judging our criteria?</span></p>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We&#8217;re sure. </span></p>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Don’t misunderstand us, we really don’t want to be one sided.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re aware that Linux is not the best. </span></p>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We just want to let you know, before start talking about the penguin, that there’s no such thing like a perfect operating system (OS). Choosing a software doesn’t involve <a href="https://www.pornpolis.blog/pornhub/"><strong>pornhub</strong></a> the perfect features of a full package program. Instead, is more of a taste and personal functionality decision. In fact, the first question that we have to do before buying an OS, should be: does it works for what I have to do? From then on, selecting the one, means matching different OS features with our needs. </span></p>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You may have judged the first paragraph of this article because you believe that your OS is better than Linux. If that&#8217;s the case, you might be losing the chance of buying the one that really fits your responsibilities. Forget what your heart feels about the operating system you use.</span></p>

<h2>Compare &#8211; be critical</h2>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Windows is not perfect. MacOS is not the best. Linux is not the greatest. And, there are many other OS that exits on the computer market.</span></p>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In general, the one that you use, is the one that suits your tasks. If you want to buy the one that suits you best, you will have to know all of the programs, its functions, characteristics, pros, cons and more, to find out the right one. </span></p>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As result, I don’t know about you reading this article, but we believe that Linux deserves -like every other program-, further consideration than the actual. All of the products that exist, deserve a chance to be known and proven. </span></p>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Besides critics and hate, we´ll like to spread some good information by trying to make a rational and objective article about another brand, that has always been there, but never has being as popular as it´s sisters.</span></p>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bad reputation, is unfair and lead by disinformation. There is a lot of negative reviews around of Linux, that may have influenced your decision on acquiring another OS.</span></p>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On this article, you will find a chance to know more about the famous penguin operating system, Linux. </span></p>



<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What is Linux?</b></span></h2>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before talking about the technical side of Linux, we have to explain the theory. </span></p>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">First, we need to make sure that the basis conceptualization is clear. </span></p>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Everyone knows that Linux is an operating system that’s been around for a while &#8211; even before MacOS, that was released on 1995. It holds the essence of other OS like Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Mac OS X, with a different characteristic -that we&#8217;ll explain later. </span></p>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Perhaps, in general, people doesn&#8217;t really know what’s an operating system &#8211; unless you’re some kind of computer engineer or that you have a job related with computers. By “knowing”, we refer to actually have the capability of explaining what it is.</span></p>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The OS, is simply a software. An operating system, is in charge of managing all of your desktop or laptop hardware. It basically controls communication between the software and the hardware. And, you need it&#8217;s functions to keep the laptop alive. </span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1583109193439-1ebb113bceac?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80" alt="green and black audio mixer"/></figure></div>



<h2>Key points</h2>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An OS, specifically Linux, is composed by the following parts:</span></p>



<ol class="ol1"><li class="li1"><span class="s1">The kernel: this part is meant to be the heart of the whole system that manages the CPU, memory and other devices. Kernel is the one piece that we called Linux and is the “lowest” level of all the OS. </span></li><li class="li1"><span class="s1">The Bootloader: it manages the boot process in any Linux compatible CPU. This piece is the famous starting page that appears once we had turn on the CPU. </span></li><li class="li1"><span class="s1">Daemons: this piece comes into action after turning on the computer. Daemons, is not a lonely tool but all of the devices that comprised Linux; such as, the printer, calculator, schedule, calendar, and others. </span></li><li class="li1"><span class="s1">Graphical Server or X: subsystem that displays graphics on your screen. </span></li><li class="li1"><span class="s1">Shell: an original piece of the penguin. It&#8217;s basically a command process that allows you to control the computer by typing commands into the text interface. If your not someone related with codes and computers, you have just find the floor where people got scared of the penguin world, in the past; back then, people would had to learn some codes properly to successfully manage the OS. Nowadays, you don’t have to do this anymore.</span></li><li class="li1"><span class="s1">Desktop environment: the part where people interacts with the OS. Linux has a wide layout of environments to choose from; such as:<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Unity, GNOME, Cinnamon, Enlightenment, etc. </span><span class="s1">Additionally, each one of these environments have built-in characteristics, for the user; such as: file managers, configuration tools,games, etc.&nbsp;</span></li><li class="li1"><span class="s1">Applications: everyone&#8217;s favorite part in an OS. Linux offers thousands of software to install and enjoy, but it doesn’t provide the full army. Nowadays, some Linux softwares, include application stores to simplify the finding process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span></li></ol>



<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Linux time line</b></span></h2>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now that we actually know what is an OS, let’s get deep into Linux history. </span></p>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Linux story started back in the early 90’s when the </span><span class="s2">Finnish student Linus Torvalds, started a personal project of creating a free OS. On 1991, Linux kernel, was initially released and it hasn’t stopped growing since then. </span></p>



<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The penguin origins, go back to early 70&#8217;s when the Unix operating system was implemented by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie, from the AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories (1969), released in 1970. And specifically, to their portable and modifiable programming language, called C. On which Linux kernel creator wrote his program. </span></p>



<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On 1992 Linux distributions was created along with the relicensed GNU GPL, starting an era of unstoppable growing to Torvalds creation. </span></p>



<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It wasn’t until 2007, until the GNU (General Public License), Linux free software license, was finally consolidated with GPLv3 released, marking this part of the story as a new programing adaptation era, for the OS. </span></p>

<h2>Gaining popularity</h2>



<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Also on 2007, Dell was distributing for the first time, laptops with preinstalled Ubuntu (Linux famous distribution base), improving its market. </span></p>



<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But, is fair to say, that the penguin free software system, started it’s massification way before, with IBMs support on 1998; followed by Dell on 2000, year when Microsoft and Linux rivality got aggressive, until 2006 when peace was proclaimed by Microsoft and Novell, by the announcement of a cooperation that enhance better interoperability and mutual patent protection.</span></p>



<p class="p2"><span class="s1">2011, was the year for Linux kernel consolidation on the new era, when Version 3.0 was released. A year later, Linux server market revenue exceeded the Unix market. Getting to the top, back in 2013, when Google&#8217;s Linux-Android, claim the big trophy of a 75% smartphone market share.</span></p>



<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On 2015, latest Linux 4.0 arrived the game. Nowadays, Linux has tons of environments and is used almost anywhere. </span></p>

<p>The girl needs to understand that her intercourse may be painful, but this discomfort passes quickly, opening an interesting journey into the world of erotica.</p>



<h3><strong>Physiological readiness for first sex</strong></h3>



<p>Young people often ask the main question , what is the optimal age for first sex, worrying about the physical state of the body for sexual intercourse.</p>



<p>It is known that in the course of a scientific experiment, which scientists have conducted over 10 years, was set the ideal age for a woman&#8217;s first sexual intimacy &#8211; 18-19 years.</p>



<p>This early contact before 17 years and later after 22 years, the researchers say, is connect with complications to health. Similar recommendations sexologists give men. At the same time women have to know that puberty, which manifests the onset of menstruation, is not a reason to start intimacy.</p>



<p>It is not recommended to intercourse until the menstrual cycle is not stable, and this requires 2-3 years after the onset of menses. But given that they can start with a 9-10 years period of time before the onset of sexual activity should be much more.</p>



<p>According to statistics, 36% of adolt people have sexual relations before the age of 16, with more than half of them after regret it.</p>



<p>Early sexual activity has a number of negative consequences:</p>



<ul><li>The risk of sexually transmitted and infectious diseases due to poor awareness of contraceptive methods and the lack of a permanent partner;</li><li>Unintended pregnancy;</li><li>Increased risk of cervical cancer; -psychological problems associated with the distorted idea about sex or, conversely, its negation.</li></ul>



<p>Speaking negatively about early sexual intercourse, sexologists are advised not to delay, because it is fraught with hormonal disorders, mental disorders, lack of women orgasm.</p>

<h3><strong>Shychological readiness for the first sex</strong></h3>



<p>In the life of every girl&#8217;s deflowering (violation of the hymen) provides access to a full sex life, which can be purchased as a positive color, and leave negative memories. Age of first sex today dropped significantly.</p>



<p>For psychological comfort intimacy is possible only in the most familiar surroundings, where you can feel more uninhibited and use familiar objects.</p>

<h3><strong>How to found out man want you or nоt?</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>Signs of interest to woman.</strong></h3>



<p>Representatives of the stronger sex rarely show feelings, even if the lady desirable for him. They mask the emotions ostentatious indifference, caustic jokes. The girls are often loss, not knowing, like she or he is an ordinary flirtation. I</p>



<p>n order to make it easier to understand, there are a number of signs that show the true attitude of the young man. If a guy tries to be close by, offering friendship, strongly involved in the life of a girl, it proves that he considers her charming and suggests a further link.</p>

<h3><strong>Recognizing the signs of sexual attraction.</strong></h3>



<p>Signs of sexual attraction of a young man to the object of signs and the desire to have a lady appear in gifts with overtones, specially prepared words, demonstrating that the gentleman wants intimacy with the object of love. If the girl was presented with erotic lingerie, it is a veiled suggestion to have sex.</p>



<p>The young man admired the female body, so is a prerequisite touch. In contrast to the friendly, it will be more tender, easy, often simulating a random gesture. It should be noted that the guys are very developed sense of smell, and to awaken the desire is enough to smell a woman. </p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. In three sentences or less, tell us “your story” as an entrepreneur </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jimmy: I started in the whole online scene about 4-5 years  ago. Back then, no one taught me the tricks of the trade so I had to spend about 1-2 hours everyday just reading and studying how things worked. I had to do my 9-5 job, worked online for about 2-3 hours, then dedicated another 2  hours just to study. To date, I still spend about 1-2 hours of my time everyday just to read and learn (not including weekends). I find my commitment to studying as one of the crucial things that helped me achieve the level of success that I have right now.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. In three sentences or less, tell  us about your business. </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">JR: I offer online writing services. While I cater to a diverse audience, I mostly write for business owners and journalists. These days, however, I mostly write for journalists and authors who contribute on top-tier magazine sites like Forbes and Entrepreneur, among others. Everything that I write for my clients is ghostwritten.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. What inspired you to start your  business? </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">JR: It was when I learned that my wife was pregnant. I knew that the amount I earned from my 9-5 job just wasn&#8217;t going to cut it, so I looked to freelancing online to make ends meet. In a matter of 3-4 months, I started to earn more from just working 2-3 hours online, compared to my day job. It was at this point that I decided to join the online bandwagon and do it full time. Related Article: 10 Questions With Sarah Landrum: Business.com Market Expert of the Month</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4. What is the most  rewarding (and the most challenging) part of what you do?</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">JR: The most rewarding part for me is being able to spend time with my family everyday . Hearing my daughter and wife laugh as I work just reminds me of how blessed I am to be where I am at right now. The most challenging part for me would probably be staying disciplined with my work. Running a business at home can be quite challenging because of all the distractions.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5. Which current marketing trends  do you see as “the future”?</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">JR: I’d say that everyone’s focus in publishing (and consuming) quality content is quite evident. The content consumers are starting to get really vocal about their thoughts on whatever they read online, and the search engines are starting to really recognize what’s good content and what isn’t. This is good news for someone like me who provides affordable, yet high quality writing services. This makes my services all the more relevant to the industry.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>6. What do you believe makes for successful marketing? </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">JR: For me, genuine relationship building is the key. I’m a huge fan of befriending my clients (or prospects). I have found that doing so makes my relationship with them even more meaningful, and it almost always translates to more projects and even referrals.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>7. If you had to give the former you a few words of advice, what would they be? </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">JR: Pray. Without God in your life, you are bound to fail (even if you think you’ve succeeded). Remember that apart from God, you are nothing. Focus. I think a lot of online entrepreneurs are struggling with the shiny object syndrome. I’ve had my fair share of experiencing it so my expertise ended up becoming diluted, instead of becoming laser focused on one thing.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>8. How has your experience in the Business.com Market Expert Program benefitted your business and career?</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">JR: Through reading my articles at Business.com, a couple of clients had asked about my writing services. The Market Expert Program did not only help me in terms of expanding my knowledge and learning from industry experts, but I also had several leads contact me through my profile at Related Article: 10 Questions With Brian Hughes: Business.com Market Expert of the Month</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>9. Which entrepreneur do you look up to, and why?</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">JR: I’m a huge fan of Zig Ziglar. Though he’s no longer in this world, the ideas he shared are priceless. Reading his book The Secrets of Closing a Sale really opened my eyes to the dynamics of of how to influence others into becoming actual buyers of my products &#8211; and how to keep them as buyers. His ideas are solid and are very well articulated. But what I like most of all is how they are effective. I tried them myself, so I know at 100% that they flat out work!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>10. What’s your favorite motivational quote? </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">JR: My first one is a bible verse. &#8220;Unless the Lord builds a house, the work of the builders is wasted. Unless the Lord protects a city, guarding it with sentries will do no good,&#8221; Psalm 127:1.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My second one is &#8220;Whether you think you can, or you think you can&#8217;t—you&#8217;re right” from Henry Ford.

<p><strong>6 Things That Will Ruin Your Meeting (And How to Prevent Them)</strong><br>When executed well, a good meeting can provide a ton of benefits for a group of colleagues.</p>



<p>Getting together to go over project planning, communicate with external vendors, and finalize details is fundamental to any organization. But just as colleagues can leave a meeting feeling accomplished, they can also leave feeling confused about what needs to be done. Worse,<strong> they can exit a meeting feeling as though their time has been wasted</strong> – and when you’re in a busy company, every minute counts. That’s why you should be able to identify pain points in your typical meeting setup, and how you can avoid them. A good meeting should provide clarity and unity to a situation; a bad meeting can muddy the waters even further. Fortunately, <em>there are plenty of ways you can turn a bad meeting around</em>, and even more ways to avoid getting stuck in the first place.</p>

</div></figure>



<h3><strong>Problem #1: Lack of Purpose</strong></h3>



<p>This might be pretty obvious for the first meeting problem on our list, but it’s also probably the biggest. “It is interesting how tightly some companies try to control small expenses, yet anyone in the company is permitted to call a meeting of a dozen people and waste thousands of payroll dollars,” says an article at<em> Time Management Ninja</em>.<strong> “Often, hastily scheduled meetings result in wasting large numbers of wasted hours, especially when you multiply it by all of those present.”</strong> You need to make sure a meeting will be time well spent.</p>



<p>So before you make the decision, step back and consider whether or not you actually need a meeting. Can this be resolved over an email thread, or a conference call? If so, go with either of these routes instead – they will keep employees free to multitask while they contribute. But if you believe that a face-to-face group meeting will be beneficial, then <em>set it up.</em> Just be sure to send out invitations to the meeting with enough notice – your colleagues likely have their own busy schedules, and <em>they’ll probably need to work your meeting in amongst others.</em></p>



<h3><strong>Problem #2: Not Checking Equipment Beforehand</strong></h3>



<p>Imagine spending all your time on a great PowerPoint presentation, but once you arrive at the meeting room, you don’t have a projector or a working computer available, or a cord is missing, or the files are unreadable by the computer. Nothing sinks a meeting faster than not having vital information available <em>because of a simple (or not so simple) tech issue.</em></p>



<p>When you’re booking the meeting, take a look at the space where you’ll be holding it, and make a note of the equipment that will be available to you – you won’t want to Skype in a bunch of out-of-town colleagues <strong>if you don’t have the tech! </strong>Once you’ve got an idea of what the phone and computer capabilities will be like in the meeting room, you can then plan out what multimedia you can use.</p>



<p>On the day of the meeting, if you’re bringing your own files, put them on a thumb drive and email backup copies to an inbox you can easily access in case of emergency – and instruct the same of any attendees bringing data or presentations to display. Also, be sure you know how to reach the nearest IT person if a phone cuts out in the middle of the meeting or <em>if a computer stops working.</em></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1450101499163-c8848c66ca85?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80" alt="man writing on paper"/></figure></div>



<h3><strong>Problem #3: Lack of Preparation</strong></h3>



<p>Time Management Ninja puts it plainly: <strong>“No preparation will kill a meeting before it starts. If you walk into the room at the last second, then spend 20 minutes getting the computer working or making handouts, you have already wasted half of the time.”</strong></p>



<p>Instead, give yourself at least 15 minutes beforehand and get the room prepared. If you have handouts to provide to your attendees, make sure you’ve got them printed out and ready to go. (Likewise, if the people attending your meeting need to come prepared with documents of their own, give them advance notice so they can put their notes together.) Having everything ready ahead of time will go a long way in ensuring that your meeting starts on time. </p>

<p><strong>Emphasize clearly when the meeting will start</strong>, and decide in advance how long of a grace period you’ll allow for attendees to show up. Latecomers can disrupt the flow of a meeting agenda, so be ruthless in closing the door and starting your meeting on time!</p>



<h3><strong>Problem #4: No Clear Agenda</strong></h3>



<p>Speaking of agendas, if you missed <strong>Problem #1</strong>, you’re likely heading into a meeting without any sort of defined order as to how the time will be spent. While this format might work for something like a loose brainstorm session, you’re going to want your meeting to accomplish something, and so you’ll need to determine what points need to be covered – <strong>and for how long</strong>.</p>



<p>A good meeting needs structure, and that’s where an agenda comes in. Figure out in advance what items you want to cover, and establish how much time should be spent on each. Once you have this accomplished, put it in a document and make <em>printouts for everyone attending</em>, so people will know what will be covered and just how much time will be spent on each item.</p>



<h3><strong>Problem #5: No Help&nbsp;Planning</strong></h3>



<p>An important meeting is stressful enough, and planning a meeting with no help can be a huge obstacle to overcome. If you’re planning your meeting for an offsite location, make sure that you pick a location with knowledgeable staff that understands the intricacies of what you need from your event. <em>The more help, the better.</em></p>



<h3><strong>Problem #6: No Objective </strong></h3>



<p>As with a lack of agenda, a missing objective can sink a meeting. If you can’t clearly state just what you hope to accomplish through a group meeting, then it can seem like a waste of time for everyone involved. “Every meeting should have a planned success or outcome,” advises Time Management Ninja. <strong>What is to be accomplished in the meeting? It could be a decision to be made, or a budget approved.</strong></p>



<p>Whatever it is, make it part of the meeting details when you send out the invites.” Not only does this give a meeting some credibility, it also helps the attendees have a goal to<em> work towards. </em>Also, when you’re putting together your agenda, include a clearly defined goal at the very top of the page.</p>



<p>If your attendees have a sense upfront of what needs to be accomplished, they’ll be more focused and feel more productive by the end of the session. </p>

<p>Instead, always make sure that your objective is communicated to the team, and that all the necessary materials are ready to go. With a few quick fixes to common problems, you’ll be able to host a meeting that’s both productive and valuable to your organization.<strong> What’s your top issue with meetings, and how do you get around it?
